# M-CMS

M-CMS is a custom Content Management System 
with easy to use interface, rights management 
and plug-in system.

Templates allow total freedom in design and 
usability.

Front and back end are muli lingual. UTF-8 is 
supported as well as other codecs. 

Categories group different sections and possible 
menu throughout the website. 
Categories can be hidden from indexing or only 
accessible for logged in users. 
(plug-ins for sign-up, newsletter and more are 
available) 

Pages and Subpages are managed via binary tree. 
So there's no limit on the levels of the menus.

Pages belong to an owner and the last person 
who edited the page is the current editor.

Rights to edit can be set per category, template,
language or even per individual page or plug-in. 

M-CMS can operate headless too with the right 
templates and output formats (JSON or XML i.e.).

M-CMS has been developed in PHP, mySQL and jquery. 

M-CMS is fast. Usually in the 90s on Pagespeed.
Just now webp support has been added and existing 
img-tags will be replaced with picture-syntax and 
sources if applicable. 

It sadly needs better documentation wich I'll try 
to address. 

Have fun taking it for a test drive ðŸ˜€
